# Test writing a markdown page

Some content might be written in markdown instead of HTML/CSS

It's easier for sharing code for instance:
```c++
// Example C++ code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    cout << "Pierre says hello" << endl;
  
    return 0;
}
```

> Just a dummy markdown page to see how it looks
